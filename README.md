# Notion-Style Editor with AI Chat üìù

A modern note-taking application inspired by Notion, featuring a rich text editor and an embedded AI chat for each note. Built with **Next.js**, **TipTap**, **Zustand**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this project offers a seamless user experience with autosave, responsive design, and mock AI responses.

üöÄ **Features**

* **Sidebar Navigation**: Create, switch, and delete notes with a collapsible sidebar.
* **Rich Text Editor**: Powered by TipTap, supporting:

  * Text formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough, code).
  * Headings (H1‚ÄìH6).
  * Bullet and ordered lists.
  * Code blocks and blockquotes.
  * Undo/redo functionality.
* **AI Chat**: Each note has its own chat history with a floating AI assistant:

  * Send prompts and receive mock responses.
  * Messages update in real-time with optimistic UI updates.
* **Autosave**: Note content and chat history are automatically saved to `localStorage`:

  * Saves while typing and when switching notes.
* **Responsive Design**: Clean UI with Tailwind CSS, including light/dark mode support.
* **State Management**: Uses Zustand for efficient global state handling.
